Project Overview: Online Sales Data Analysis
Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of online sales transactions to extract meaningful insights that can help in understanding sales trends, customer preferences, and overall business performance. The insights will aid in making data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing strategies, and sales optimization.

Product Name: Specific name or model of the product sold.
Units Sold: Number of units of the product sold in the transaction.
Unit Price: Price of one unit of the product.
Total Revenue: Total revenue generated from the sales transaction (Units Sold * Unit Price).
Region: Geographic region where the transaction occurred (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).
Payment Method: Method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, Debit Card).
